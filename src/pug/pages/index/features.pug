        | Intent-Based Execution
      h3.features-list__title One signature. Infinite logic.
      p.features-list__text Execute any logic, on any contract, across any chain — exactly how, where and when you need — with a single signed transaction.

        | Chain Abstraction
      h3.features-list__title Execute across chains.
      p.features-list__text Compose workflows across chains. Ditto abstracts away cross-chain complexity — users never see the underlying execution flow.

        | Conditional Workflows
      h3.features-list__title Execute exactly how you want.
      p.features-list__text Trigger execution based on price, gas cost, time, on-chain events, contract state diffs, or define your own unique custom execution logic. Ditto executes it trustlessly.

        | Composable Runtime Execution
      h3.features-list__title Deploy intent, not infrastructure.
      p.features-list__text Design powerful, modular logic flows that execute on demand. Build reusable execution primitives once — deploy them instantly with signed intents, across contracts and chains.
