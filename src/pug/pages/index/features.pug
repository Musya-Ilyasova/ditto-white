        | Intent-Based Execution
      h3.features-list__title One signature. Infinite logic.
      p.features-list__text Execute custom logic with any contract, on any chain — exactly where and when you need it — all in a single signed transaction.

        | Chain Abstraction
      h3.features-list__title Execute across chains.
      p.features-list__text Compose workflows across chains. Ditto abstracts away cross-chain complexity — users never see the underlying execution flow.

        | Conditional Workflows
      h3.features-list__title Add conditional logic to your workflows.
      p.features-list__text Trigger execution based on price, gas cost, time, on-chain events, or contract state changes. Build workflows that react precisely to real-time conditions — or run fully unconditional when needed.

        | Composable Execution Builder
      h3.features-list__title Build smarter, ship faster.
      p.features-list__text Avoid setting up your own execution stack. Ditto turns intents into automated pipelines — handling decoding, batching, routing, timing, and sequencing across chains. You focus on product. Ditto powers the execution.

        | Account Abstraction

        | Consensus-Driven Execution
      h3.features-list__title Delegate execution risk to Ditto.
      p.features-list__text Your workflows are validated by a decentralized network of operators, not a single actor. Every operation is simulated, attested, and settled transparently, with 66%+ consensus required for execution. Ditto turns automation into a secure, slashable, and trustless process — so your team can focus on building, not on execution risk.
